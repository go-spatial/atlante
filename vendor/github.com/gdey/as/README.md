# as
A simple library to coerce interface values into known values

## Note
Heavily borrowing from: https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/blob/master/conv/conv.go

The main difference is this pacakge does not do as much, and returns an ok value to let 
the caller know if it was able to do the conversion.

This package is not as complete as that package
